# instacopy
Copies someone's following list to follow with your account.

# how to use
Edit the data.txt file with your username, password info (no, I won't store your data lol), the account you want to copy, and the directory of the Chrome driver. It's really that easy, if you're too lazy to edit the code itself.
(((but what is a Chrome driver senpai??)))
download it here first: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
(((but what is a directory senpai??)))
the location where you store that Chrome driver file. just click the Chrome driver >> right click >> properties >> copy the "Location" text

# to add
Follower copy feature (more useful for online shops; unsure what's the purpose of this for personal accounts)
