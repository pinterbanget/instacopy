# instacopy
Copies someone's following list to follow with your account.

# how to use
Edit the data.txt file with your username, password info, and the account you want to copy (no, I won't store your data lol). It's really that easy, if you're too lazy to edit the code itself.

# to add
Follower copy feature (more useful for online shops; unsure what's the purpose of this for personal accounts)
